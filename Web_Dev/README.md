#### About our Website

For Project 1, We created our website for CDY consisting of a homepage, a login page, a products page, a delivery page, and a checkout page.
We made this website by utilizing HTML and CSS.

For Project 2, We decided to go with the JavaScript Framework React and use NextJS which is a fullstack framework built with React + Node. 
We are also utilizing typescript, SASS, react-icons, react-spinners, leaflet (similar to Google Maps).
We also updated our website to include a web framework to make the website look better.

For Project 3, we have created and uploaded different diagrams on how different parts of our website works.
